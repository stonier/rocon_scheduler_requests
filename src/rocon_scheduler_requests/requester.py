.. module:: requester

Python interface for ROCON services making scheduler requests.

This module provides a relatively simple API, not requiring detailed
knowledge of scheduler request messages or state transitions.

class Requester(object):
    """
    This class is used by a ROCON service to handle its resource
    requests.  When an instance of :class:`.Requester` is created, it
    creates its own scheduler feedback topic and connects to the ROCON
    scheduler topic.

    :param feedback: Callback function invoked with the current
                     :class:`.RequestSet` when feedback arrives.

    :param uuid: UUID_ of this requester. If ``None`` provided, a random
                 UUID will be assigned.
    :type uuid: :class:`uuid.UUID`

    :param priority: default priority for requests from this requester.

    :param topic: Topic name for allocating resources.
    :type topic: str

    :param frequency: requester heartbeat frequency in Hz.  Use the
                      default, except in exceptional situations or for
                      testing.
    :type frequency: float

    As long as the :class:`.Requester` object remains, it will
    periodically send request messages to the scheduler, even when no
    requests are outstanding.  The scheduler will provide feedback for
    them if anything has changed.  The caller-provided *feedback*
    function will be invoked each time a feedback message arrives,
    like this:

    .. describe:: feedback(rset)

       :param rset: The current set of requests including any updates
                    from the scheduler.
       :type rset: :class:`.RequestSet`

    The *feedback* function is expected to iterate over its
    :class:`.RequestSet`, checking the status of every
    :class:`.ResourceRequest` it contains, and modify them
    appropriately.  If any changes occur, the scheduler will be
    notified after this callback returns.
